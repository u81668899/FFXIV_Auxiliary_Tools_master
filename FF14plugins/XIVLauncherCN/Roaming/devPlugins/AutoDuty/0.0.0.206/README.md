# AutoDuty

<img align="right" width="150" height="150" src="logo.png">

AutoDuty (AD) is a Dalamud plugin for FFXIV that serves as a tool to assist in the creation and following of paths through dungeons and duties. It's designed to enable automatic looping of instanced content with Duty Support, Trusts, or Squadrons.

Support for it can be found in the [this channel](https://discord.com/channels/1001823907193552978/1236757595738476725) of the [Puni.sh Discord server](https://discord.gg/punishxiv).

# Dungeon Paths

<img align="right" height="250" src="Assets/paths.png">

Each dungeon supported by AutoDuty has a pre-configured path laid out, which should complete the dungeon without any issues. If any issues are encountered, make sure to reach out in the [support Discord](https://discord.gg/punishxiv).

The paths will also run over all loot containers and, when configured, will pick up the loot and do something with it while either in between dungeon runs or after your set amount of runs are over.

Creating paths is also supported and easily accomplished within AutoDuty by using the `Build` tab at the top. For path status, please refer to the [pinned spreadsheet](https://discord.com/channels/1001823907193552978/1236757595738476725/1243059104528994334) in the [AutoDuty channel](https://discord.com/channels/1001823907193552978/1236757595738476725) of the [support Discord](https://discord.gg/punishxiv).

# Automatic Leveling

<img align="right" height="250" src="Assets/leveling.png">

AutoDuty has a leveling feature that will continuously run you through the "correct" dungeon to level through. The dungeon is typically determined by path quality, support for boss fights, and obviously the level of the dungeon.

With AutoDuty, you can level a job from 15 to the max level very quickly and fully AFK, provided you have the correct gear and the option in the AD configuration to automatically equip the best gear.

This plugin can also level trusts for you in the same way it levels your jobs. It can intelligently select trust members and level them all to max, fully AFK.

# Automations

AutoDuty supports a wide range of automations and integrations with other plugins. Below are just some of what AD can offer while automating instanced content:

| Before runs | During the run | Between runs | After the runs |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Move to an inn, house, or FC house <br /> Auto self- or NPC- repair <br /> Execute commands (i.e. SND scripts) <br /> Auto consume items | Loot treasure coffers <br /> Manage plugin states | Auto extract materia <br /> Auto desynth loot <br /> Auto turn in loot to GC <br /> Use AutoRetainer <br /> Auto equip best gear | Stop looping at a level <br /> Stop looping when you run out of rested XP <br /> Turn on AutoRetainer multi mode <br /> Shut down your computer |

# Getting help

When you've found a bug or think you have an issue with the plugin, please ask in [this channel](https://discord.com/channels/1001823907193552978/1236757595738476725) in the [Puni.sh Discord server](https://discord.gg/punishxiv). It might be a known issue or people might be able to help you quickly. Additionally, sometimes it might be an issue with one of the required plugins.
